Eine has now built an exceptional worldwide reputation and wanted a brand that positioned him as a credible contemporary artist.</p><p>The solution was to combine the black paint drips that Eine uses on the edges of his unique canvases with Eine’s signature Circus font. By mixing several processes; embossing, screen printing onto duplexed card and applying varnish to create a high gloss finish an outstanding result  was achieved. Created at Root.</p>",
