		"description": "<p>Ben Eine is one of the UK’s most prolific and original street artists specialising in grand, colourful lettering. Eine has now built an exceptional worldwide reputation and wanted a brand that positioned him as a credible contemporary artist.</p><p>My solution was to combine the black paint drips that Eine uses on the edges of his unique canvases with Eine’s signature Circus font. Applying the identity to a stationery range an outstanding result was achieved by mixing several processes; embossing, screen printing onto duplexed card and applying varnish to achieve a high gloss finish.</p>",

The final identity was  rolled out across stationery, website and apparel.</p><p>Sculptivate and their clients were extremely  pleased with the result. The identity was also featured in the Victionary book I Heart Avant Garde and the Rockport book 1000 Paper Graphics.</p>",

The film had to be interesting, informative, fun and memorable.</p><p>Instead of going down the route of an ‘infomercial’ I found inspiration in the 1970-80s, the period that Space Invaders originated in. After watching a few ‘vintage’ YouTube clips of Tomorrow’s World - the TV gadget show seemed the perfect fit for the level of product information we had to convey. I created a script and storyboard for ‘Tomorrow’s Way Today’  (or ‘TWT’), cast appropriate presenters, commissioned a suitably retro TV set build  and directed on the day.</p><p><a href='http://vimeo.com/84179299' target='_blank'>View video</a></p>",
